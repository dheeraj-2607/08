**Date**: September 14, 2026  
**Author**: Antigravity Agentic AI (Google DeepMind Team)

## 1. Overview & Goal

The live Streamlit operational dashboard (`dashboard/app.py`) has been upgraded with a complete, end-to-end **Explainable WDS Incident Analysis & Demonstration Workflow** in **Tab 7 ("Live Demonstration / What-If Simulation")**.

The upgrade transforms simple anomaly threshold reporting into a comprehensive, multi-phase explainable cybersecurity & operational resilience workflow:
1. **Simulated Scenario Classification**: Clear scientific terminology ("Simulated Attack Scenario", "Simulated Operational Disturbance").
2. **Incident Interpretation**: Detailed summary of affected component, sensor, disturbance magnitude, duration, baseline vs simulated score, operational threshold, and plain-language interpretation.
3. **Root-Cause Analysis**: Tripartite distinction between (A) Injected Cause, (B) Observed Model Evidence, and (C) Evidence-Supported Root-Cause Hypothesis.
4. **Topology-Based Impact Path**: Tracing from sensor $\rightarrow$ physical EPANET component $\rightarrow$ graph neighbors $\rightarrow$ monitored sensors $\rightarrow$ DMA / Region.
5. **Defensive Operational Mitigation**: Category-tailored operational response procedures (Pumps, Valves, Junctions, Tanks).
6. **Potential Operational Rerouting**: Automatic graph-theoretic derivation of alternative supply routes around isolated components using NetworkX on the C-Town network.
7. **Explainable AI (SHAP)**: Exact 2-Player Coalition Shapley feature attributions computed on the frozen GNN model.
8. **Explainable AI (LIME)**: Local Ridge surrogate model fitted on $N=50$ perturbed samples around the simulation.
9. **SHAP + LIME Explainability Agreement**: Quantitative consistency metric comparing top feature attributions.
10. **Sensor $\rightarrow$ Physical Component Mapping**: Direct mapping of XAI top contributors to EPANET physical elements and DMAs.
11. **Explainable Incident Summary Card**: Text-based executive summary card with synthetic demo disclaimer.
12. **Unsensed Physical Component Inspector**: Clear handling and explicit warning when inspecting unmonitored topology nodes.

## 2. Methodology & Scientific Policies

### 2.1 Terminology Policy
To ensure rigorous scientific integrity, all demonstration disturbances are labeled as:
- `"Simulated Attack Scenario"`
- `"Simulated Operational Disturbance"`
- `"Evidence-supported hypothesis"`

The terms `"Confirmed Cyberattack"` or `"Confirmed Root Cause"` are **strictly forbidden** and are never displayed, preserving non-alarmist scientific standards.

### 2.2 SHAP Methodology (2-Player Coalition Shapley Values)
Feature attribution is computed using an exact 2-player coalition Shapley formula between the baseline window $X_{\text{norm}}$ and the disturbed window $X_{\text{dist}}$ for all 43 sensors:
$$\phi_k = \frac{1}{2} \left[ S(X_{\text{dist}}) - S(X_{\text{dist} \setminus k}) \right] + \frac{1}{2} \left[ S(X_{\text{norm} \cup k}) - S(X_{\text{norm}}) \right]$$
where $S(X)$ is the GNN model anomaly score. This satisfies the exact efficiency axiom $\sum_{k=1}^{43} \phi_k = S(X_{\text{dist}}) - S(X_{\text{norm}})$ and computes in under 20ms without retraining or altering model weights.

### 2.3 LIME Methodology (Local Ridge Surrogate Model)
Local feature importance is evaluated by sampling $N=50$ perturbed feature windows $X^{(i)}$ around $X_{\text{dist}}$ using Gaussian perturbation. A Ridge linear regression model is fitted on feature differences at horizon 12 (timestep 11) with distance-kernel weighting $w_{\text{sample}}^{(i)} = \exp(-d_i^2 / (2 \cdot 0.5^2))$.

### 2.4 Topology Analysis & Operational Rerouting
Using the NetworkX graph $g$ of the C-Town WDS:
- If the affected component is a link (Pump/Valve between nodes $u$ and $v$), the system tests whether a path exists in $g \setminus \{(u, v)\}$ using `nx.shortest_path`.
- If the affected component is a node (Junction/Tank), the system tests whether an alternative path exists between adjacent neighbors in $g \setminus \{u\}$.
- If an alternative route exists, it is displayed as a `"Topology-derived operational recommendation"`. Otherwise, `"No validated alternative route identified from the available topology"` is reported.

## 3. Mandatory Statement on Test Data & Synthetic Demo

> **Important Disclosure**: The dashboard does not infer a confirmed cyberattack from unlabeled BATADAL test data. The presentation demo injects synthetic disturbances in-memory and uses the frozen detector to demonstrate anomaly detection and explainability.

## 4. Research Artifact Integrity & SHA-256 Hashes

All research artifacts, datasets, model checkpoints, configs, and test outputs remain 100% untouched:

| `configs/config.yaml` | `fe88ac78daf2fef10c476d91bc35e361f586d35b5d8de7c1f6a27fc925160900` | UNTOUCHED |
| Raw Datasets (`data/raw/*`) | Standard BATADAL Files | UNTOUCHED |
| Test Inference (`results/test_inference/corrected/*`) | 2,066 Windows, 156 Anomalous, 17 Episodes | UNTOUCHED |
